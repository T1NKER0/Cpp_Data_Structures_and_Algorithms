• Write the definitions for the member functions get_element for the class template Pair and empty constructor Pair( ) with no argument.
• Add to the class a member function called display_pairs that displays the pairs.
• Then write a complete program that uses the class to read a pair of integers and a pair of strings and assign them to the appropriate objects, grades and names.
Here is an example of an output pair:
first pairs: 87 90
second pairs: Tom Martha
