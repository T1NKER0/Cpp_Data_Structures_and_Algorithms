Every byte in the computerâ€™s memory has an address. Addresses are numbers just as they are for our homes on a street.
When a program is loaded into the memory, depending on its size, it occupies a certain range of these addresses.
By assigning a value to a variable, we change the content in the memory location that is assigned to the variable. 
We have seen variable types that store characters, integers and floating-point numbers.
In a very similar fashion, addresses can be are stored.
A variable that stores an address value is called a pointer variable, or simply a pointer. 
There is a close association between pointers and arrays (how array elements are accessed).
In C++, an array variable is actually a pointer variable that points to the first indexed variable of the array.
Array elements can be accessed using pointer notation as well as array notation.
